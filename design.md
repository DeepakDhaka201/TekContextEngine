Okay now i want to dive deeper here, for agentsHub right it should be like a wrapper where we can instantiate base agents and then there can be multiple types of them.  Exactly like : https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/ https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/llm-agents/ https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/
https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/ https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/ https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/ https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/ https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/.

Read all these docs. Now think i want to use liteLLM as the router for LLM calls for my agents . Using langfuse for tracing and observability and prompt management.

So think of it like: Wrappers on all. I can create any type of agent i want, and behind the scenes all tracebility prompt management and litellm take care of the llm works
And now these agents can be put anywhere to work, they will be our nodes. which we can use to define and create nodes, of agents connected to tools and context. right we can provide the tools, but right now we need to only focus on the agent hub, think on these things please

Edit

Architected flexible agent hub with integrated LLM routing capabilities.

AgentHub: Unified Agent Factory & Management System
Core Concept
After reviewing Google's ADK documentation, I understand you want AgentHub to be a factory and orchestration layer that can instantiate various types of agents, with LiteLLM and Langfuse transparently integrated into every agent's core functionality. These agents will later serve as composable nodes in larger workflows.

1. Base Agent Architecture
   Core Agent Interface
   Every agent, regardless of type, inherits from a base agent that provides:

Transparent LLM Integration

All LLM calls automatically route through LiteLLM
No need for agent implementers to know about LLM routing
Automatic failover and load balancing
Token tracking and budget management
Built-in Observability

Every agent action creates a Langfuse trace
Automatic span creation for agent lifecycle
Prompt versioning handled transparently
Performance metrics collected automatically
Standard Capabilities

typescript
interface IBaseAgent {
// Core identity
id: string
name: string
type: AgentType
version: string

// Execution
execute(input: AgentInput): Promise<AgentOutput>

// Lifecycle
initialize(): Promise<void>
cleanup(): Promise<void>

// State
getState(): AgentState
setState(state: Partial<AgentState>): void

// Tools & Context
bindTools(tools: Tool[]): void
setContext(context: Context): void
}
LiteLLM Integration Layer
Transparent LLM Calls When any agent needs to make an LLM call, it uses a simple interface:

typescript
// Agent code - simple and clean
const response = await this.llm.complete({
prompt: "Analyze this data",
model: "auto", // LiteLLM handles model selection
temperature: 0.7
})

// Behind the scenes - handled by base agent
// 1. LiteLLM router selects best model
// 2. Langfuse trace is created
// 3. Token usage tracked
// 4. Fallback providers ready
// 5. Response cached if appropriate
Model Selection Strategy

Agents can specify requirements (fast, cheap, powerful)
LiteLLM router makes optimal choice
Automatic fallback on failures
Cost and latency optimization
Langfuse Integration Layer
Automatic Tracing Every agent automatically creates structured traces:

3. AgentHub Implementation
   Agent Factory
   Agent Registration

typescript
class AgentHub {
private agentRegistry = new Map<string, AgentConstructor>()
private agentInstances = new Map<string, IBaseAgent>()

// Register agent types
registerAgentType(type: string, constructor: AgentConstructor) {
this.agentRegistry.set(type, constructor)
}

// Create agent instances
createAgent(config: AgentConfig): IBaseAgent {
const AgentClass = this.agentRegistry.get(config.type)
const agent = new AgentClass(config)

    // Automatic instrumentation
    this.instrumentAgent(agent)
    
    return agent
}
}
Automatic Instrumentation Every agent created through AgentHub gets:

LiteLLM client injection
Langfuse tracer attachment
Metrics collector binding
Error boundary wrapping
Agent Lifecycle Management
Initialization Phase

Agent instantiation
Dependency injection (LiteLLM, Langfuse)
Tool binding
Context initialization
State restoration (if resuming)
Health check
Execution Phase

Input validation
Trace creation
State checkpoint
Core execution
Result validation
State update
Cleanup Phase

Resource deallocation
State persistence
Trace completion
Metrics flush
Connection cleanup
Context & Tool Integration
Context Injection Agents receive context through a standardized interface:

User context (profile, preferences)
Session context (conversation history)
System context (available resources)
Domain context (business data)
Tool Binding Agents can be bound to tools dynamically:

typescript
agent.bindTools([
jiraTool,
githubTool,
slackTool
])

// Tools are available within agent execution
const result = await this.tools.jira.createTicket({...})
Agent Composition
Agents as Nodes Each agent can be used as a node in larger workflows:

typescript
const analyzer = agentHub.createAgent({
type: 'llm',
name: 'data-analyzer'
})

const reporter = agentHub.createAgent({
type: 'llm',
name: 'report-generator'
})

const workflow = agentHub.createAgent({
type: 'sequential',
name: 'analysis-workflow',
steps: [analyzer, reporter]
})
Nested Composition Agents can contain other agents:

Sequential agents with parallel steps
Parallel agents with sequential sub-workflows
Multi-agents coordinating workflows

6. Developer Experience
   Simple Agent Creation
   typescript
   // Creating a simple LLM agent
   const agent = agentHub.create({
   type: 'llm',
   name: 'customer-support',
   prompt: 'You are a helpful customer support agent',
   tools: ['knowledge-base', 'ticket-system']
   })

// Creating a workflow
const workflow = agentHub.create({
type: 'sequential',
name: 'support-workflow',
steps: [
{ agent: 'understand-issue', type: 'llm' },
{ agent: 'search-solutions', type: 'tool' },
{ agent: 'generate-response', type: 'llm' }
]
})
Transparent Operations
Developers don't need to worry about:

LLM provider selection
Failover handling
Trace creation
Token tracking
Prompt versioning
Performance monitoring
All of this happens automatically through the AgentHub wrapper.

This architecture provides a clean, extensible way to create various types of agents while keeping the LLM and observability concerns completely transparent to the agent implementers. The agents become reusable nodes that can be composed into complex workflows while maintaining full observability and control
