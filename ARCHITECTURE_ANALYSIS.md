# Tekion Orbit - Architecture Analysis & Next Steps

## Executive Summary

We are building **Tekion Orbit** - an AI-Powered Workflow Orchestration Platform that acts as an "AI Operating System for Development Teams". This document analyzes our current progress, validates our architecture against the vision, and outlines concrete next steps.

## The Vision

Tekion Orbit transforms how development teams work by:
- **Understanding** natural language requests
- **Planning** complex multi-step workflows
- **Executing** tasks across enterprise tools autonomously
- **Learning** from each execution to improve over time

Unlike passive search tools (e.g., Glean), Orbit is an **active executor** - it doesn't just find information, it **gets things done**.

## Current State Analysis

### What We've Built

#### 1. Core Infrastructure âœ…
- **Module Registry System**: Robust dependency injection with circular dependency detection
- **Base Agent Architecture**: Solid abstractions with `IAgent`, `AgentInput`, `AgentOutput`
- **Type Safety**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors across the entire codebase
- **Test Coverage**: Multiple test suites passing (DependencyGraph: 29/29, ModuleRegistry: 29/29)

#### 2. Agent Implementations ðŸš§
- **LLM Agent**: Complete implementation with:
  - Multi-provider support via LiteLLM
  - Conversation management
  - Tool calling capabilities
  - Token usage tracking
  
- **Graph Agent**: Workflow orchestration with:
  - DAG-based execution
  - Node types: Action, Decision, Parallel, Loop
  - State management
  - Error recovery strategies

#### 3. Supporting Modules ðŸš§
- **Execution Module**: Context management for agent execution
- **Session State**: Persistent conversation and user context
- **Langfuse Integration**: Observability and tracing
- **LiteLLM Integration**: Unified LLM interface

### Architecture Validation

Our current architecture aligns well with the Orbit vision:

(Not yet built)                 â†’  Data Stores (Vector/Graph/Doc)
```

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Missing Components

1. **Tools Hub & Connectors** ðŸ”´
   - No actual tool implementations yet
   - Need connectors for: GitLab, Jira, Slack, File System
   - Tool discovery and registration system

2. **Workflow Builder** ðŸ”´
   - No UI or API for creating workflows
   - No workflow persistence/storage
   - No workflow templates

3. **Context Engine (RAG)** ðŸ”´
   - No vector database integration
   - No document indexing
   - No semantic search capabilities

4. **API Layer** ðŸ”´
   - No REST/GraphQL endpoints
   - No client SDKs
   - No authentication/authorization

5. **Execution Runtime** ðŸŸ¡
   - Graph Agent exists but not integrated
   - No workflow scheduling
   - No execution history/monitoring

## Next Steps - The Path Forward

### Phase 1: Demonstrate Core Capabilities (1-2 weeks)

**Goal**: Create a working demo showing an agent executing a simple workflow

1. **Create Basic Tools** (2-3 days)
   ```typescript
   // Priority tools to implement:
   - FileSystemTool (read/write files)
   - HTTPTool (make API calls)
   - ShellTool (execute commands)
   - SlackTool (send messages - mock for now)
   ```

2. **Build Simple API** (2 days)
   ```typescript
   // Minimal endpoints:
   POST /api/agents/execute
   GET  /api/agents/{id}/status
   GET  /api/agents/{id}/result
   ```

3. **Create Integration Test** (1 day)
   - End-to-end workflow: "Read a file, analyze it with LLM, write summary"
   - Demonstrates: Tool usage, LLM reasoning, workflow execution

4. **Build CLI Demo** (1 day)
   ```bash
   orbit execute "Analyze all TypeScript files in src/ and create a summary report"
   ```

### Phase 2: Real Tool Integration (2-3 weeks)

**Goal**: Connect to actual enterprise tools

1. **GitLab Connector**
   - List repositories
   - Read files
   - Create branches/MRs
   - Run pipelines

2. **Jira Connector**
   - Query tickets
   - Create/update tickets
   - Manage assignments

3. **Slack Connector**
   - Send messages
   - Read channels
   - Interactive responses

### Phase 3: Workflow Builder (3-4 weeks)

**Goal**: Enable non-developers to create workflows

1. **Workflow Storage**
   - Database schema
   - CRUD operations
   - Version control

2. **Builder API**
   - Node library management
   - Workflow validation
   - Template system

3. **Simple UI**
   - Drag-and-drop interface
   - Node configuration
   - Test execution

### Phase 4: Context Engine (4-5 weeks)

**Goal**: Enable intelligent context retrieval

1. **Vector Database Integration**
   - Choose solution (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant)
   - Document embedding pipeline
   - Semantic search API

2. **Knowledge Ingestion**
   - GitLab code indexing
   - Confluence document indexing
   - Jira ticket indexing

3. **Context Retrieval**
   - Multi-source aggregation
   - Relevance ranking
   - Context windowing

## Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Database Strategy**
   - PostgreSQL for relational data (workflows, executions)
   - Redis for caching and queues
   - Vector DB for embeddings (Pinecone vs Weaviate vs Qdrant)
   - Neo4j for graph relationships?

2. **API Design**
   - REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Authentication strategy (JWT, OAuth2)

3. **Deployment Architecture**
   - Kubernetes vs Docker Compose
   - Microservices vs Modular Monolith
   - Message queue (Redis vs RabbitMQ vs Kafka)

4. **Tool Framework**
   - Tool interface standardization
   - Tool versioning strategy
   - Tool permission model

## Success Metrics

1. **Phase 1 Success**: Demo executes a multi-step workflow end-to-end
2. **Phase 2 Success**: Real integration creates a Jira ticket from GitLab commit
3. **Phase 3 Success**: Non-developer creates and executes a custom workflow
4. **Phase 4 Success**: System answers: "What changed in auth system last month?"

## Risks & Mitigations

1. **Complexity Explosion**
   - Risk: System becomes too complex to maintain
   - Mitigation: Strict module boundaries, comprehensive testing

2. **Performance at Scale**
   - Risk: Slow execution with many tools/workflows
   - Mitigation: Async execution, caching, rate limiting

3. **Security Concerns**
   - Risk: Tool credentials exposure, unauthorized actions
   - Mitigation: Vault integration, audit logging, permission model

## Conclusion

We have built a **solid foundation** with excellent architectural patterns. The module system, agent abstractions, and type safety give us a strong platform to build upon.

**Immediate Priority**: Create a working demo that showcases the core value proposition - an AI that can understand a request and execute a multi-step workflow autonomously.

**The North Star**: A developer says "Fix the login bug in production" and Orbit handles everything - from finding the bug, creating a fix, testing it, and deploying it with proper approvals.

We are on the right track. The architecture supports the vision. Now we need to build the concrete implementations that bring this vision to life.
