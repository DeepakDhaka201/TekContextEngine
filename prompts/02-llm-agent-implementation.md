# LLM Agent Implementation Prompt (Enhanced with Human-in-the-Loop Integration)

## Context
You are implementing the LLM Agent - the primary "thinking" agent type in the AgentHub system. This agent uses Large Language Models for reasoning, decision-making, and generating responses. It must leverage the Enhanced Base Agent's transparent LLM and tracing capabilities while adding conversation management, tool usage, response validation, and human-in-the-loop interaction patterns. This agent integrates with the enhanced Session State module for runtime persistence and supports interactive workflows with approval gates, input requests, and collaborative decision-making.

## Pre-Implementation Requirements

### 1. Documentation Review
Before starting, you MUST:
1. Read `/Users/sakshams/tekai/TekContextEngine/agenthub-design.md` - Section 2.1 LLM Agent
2. Study Enhanced Base Agent implementation: `/Users/sakshams/tekai/TekContextEngine/prompts/07-base-agent-implementation.md`
3. Review Enhanced Session State module: `/Users/sakshams/tekai/TekContextEngine/prompts/03-session-state-module-implementation.md`
4. Study Human-in-the-Loop module: `/Users/sakshams/tekai/TekContextEngine/prompts/06c-human-loop-module-implementation.md`
5. Review Streaming Manager: `/Users/sakshams/tekai/TekContextEngine/prompts/06b-streaming-manager-implementation.md`
6. Study Google ADK LLM Agent documentation: https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/llm-agents/
7. Research conversation memory patterns for LLMs with state persistence
8. Study tool/function calling patterns in modern LLMs
9. Research human-in-the-loop patterns for LLM agents

### 2. Understand Enhanced Base Agent Capabilities
Before implementing, verify you understand:
- How Enhanced BaseAgent handles LLM calls transparently with INode compatibility
- How tracing is automatically managed with Langfuse integration
- Enhanced state management APIs with runtime persistence
- Tool binding mechanisms with module registry
- Error handling patterns with human fallback
- Streaming capabilities for real-time interactions
- Human-in-the-loop integration points
- Session state persistence for long-running conversations

### 3. Enhanced Architecture Analysis
Think deeply about:
- How to manage conversation context efficiently with runtime state persistence
- When to summarize vs. keep full history with session state integration
- How to handle tool calls recursively with human approval gates
- Response validation strategies with human review workflows
- Prompt template management with variable resolution from session state
- Token optimization strategies with streaming and state checkpoints
- Human interaction timing and workflow integration
- Session state recovery for interrupted conversations
- Real-time streaming with human intervention points
- Variable and template state management across conversation turns

11. Are human approval workflows efficient and user-friendly?
12. Does the agent handle concurrent human interactions correctly?
13. Is real-time streaming with state persistence working reliably?
14. Are human interaction patterns learned and optimized over time?

## Next Steps
Once the Enhanced LLM Agent with human-in-the-loop integration is complete and tested, it provides a foundation for interactive AI workflows with:

1. **Seamless Human Collaboration** - Natural approval and input workflows
2. **Persistent State Management** - Reliable conversation resume and context preservation
3. **Real-time Streaming with Interaction** - Live collaboration with human oversight
4. **Intelligent Decision Making** - AI reasoning combined with human judgment
5. **Session-aware Conversations** - Context and variable management across long interactions

The enhanced LLM agent now integrates fully with the Enhanced Session State module and provides the foundation for sophisticated human-AI collaborative workflows in the AgentHub system.
